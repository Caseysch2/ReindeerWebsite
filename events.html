	<h2>When You Visit</h2>
	<div class="content-section">
		Please help us make your visit a safe and pleasant experience for you and the reindeer.
		<div class="list-with-image">
			<ul>
				<li>
					Our farm is our home and visits are by appointment only. 
				</li>
				<li>
					No pets.
				</li>
				<li>
					Please do not feed the reindeer unless the handler allows you to.
				</li>
				<li>
					Our reindeer do not eat candy or cookies. Please do not bring them into the pen.
				</li>
				<li>
					Screaming and quick movements startle the reindeer. Please use inside voices.
				</li>
				<li>
					You may pet the reindeer! But only under the supervision of the handler.
				</li>
				<li>
					When lines are long, please be considerate of others who are also waiting.
				</li>
				<li>
					Please don't wear boots or clothing that has been recently exposed to <em>goats or sheep</em>. Goats and sheep harbor an airborne virus that is deadly to the reindeer.
				</li>
				<li>
					Please park where the parking attendants request.
				</li>
				<li>
					Please put all trash in the proper containers. Reindeer, like infants, are very curious and will put everything in their mouths.
				</li>
