			<ul>
				<li>
					Our farm is our home and <b>visits are by appointment only</b>. 
				</li>
				<li>
					No pets.
				</li>
				<li>
					Please do not feed the reindeer unless the handler allows you to.
				</li>
				<li>
					Our reindeer do not eat candy or cookies. Please do not bring them into the pen.
				</li>
				<li>
					Screaming and quick movements startle the reindeer. Please use inside voices.
				</li>
				<li>
					You may pet the reindeer! But only under the supervision of the handler.

				<li>
					Please be considerate of others who are waiting for time with the reindeer.

What you WILL see is a sign at the end of the driveway "Reindeer Dr". This is the entrance to our driveway, please enter and follow the instructions of the parking attendants.
