	<h3>Charity Events</h3>	
		<p>PTSA recognition day Dec. 27 has sold out! We are donating the $2,000 in farm visit registration fees to support our local PTSA's SnackPack program, sending food home with kids who need it.
 Thank you to all who purchased tickets to help us fight hunger in our school district.</p>	
               <p>In the 2024 holiday season we volunteered to host or to travel with the reindeer to visit 12 special groups including people with developmental disabilities or special needs, Veterans Affairs facility residents, families fighting 
		       childhood cancer, and groups collecting food for our neighbors. We are grateful that we are able to do this, and thankful for the people who support these special groups all year long. </p>
