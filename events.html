			<ul>
				<li>
					Our farm is our home and <b>visits are by appointment only</b>. 
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>No pets.</b>
				</li>
				<li>
					Please do not feed the reindeer unless the handler allows you to.
				</li>
				<li>
					Screaming and quick movements startle the reindeer. Please use inside voices.
				</li>
				<li>
					You may pet the reindeer! But only under the supervision of the handler.
				</li>
				<li>
					Please be considerate of others who are waiting for time with the reindeer.
