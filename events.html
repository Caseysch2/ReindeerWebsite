	<h2>When You Visit</h2>
	<div class="content-section">
		Please help us make your visit a safe and pleasant experience for you and the reindeer.
		<div class="list-with-image">
			<ul>
				<li>
					Our farm is our home and <b>visits are by appointment only</b>. 
				</li>
				<li>
					No pets.
				</li>
				<li>
					Please do not feed the reindeer unless the handler allows you to.
				</li>
				<li>
					Our reindeer do not eat candy or cookies. Please do not bring them into the pen.
				</li>
				<li>
					Screaming and quick movements startle the reindeer. Please use inside voices.
				</li>
				<li>
					You may pet the reindeer! But only under the supervision of the handler.
				</li>
				<li>
					Please be considerate of others who are waiting for time with the reindeer.
				</li>
				<li>
					Please don't wear boots or clothing that has been recently exposed to <em>goats or sheep</em>. Goats and sheep harbor an airborne virus that is deadly to the reindeer.
				</li>
				<li>
					Please park where the parking attendants request.
				</li>
				<li>
					Please put all trash in the proper containers. Reindeer, like infants, are very curious and will put everything in their mouths.

				We are fairly easy to get to, however, you will not see our house, barn, or reindeer from the road. We are set back off the road about 1000ft. What you WILL see is a sign at the end of the driveway "Reindeer Dr". This is the entrance to our driveway, please enter and follow the instructions of the parking attendants.
