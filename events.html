			The reindeer travel to events around New York State. Want to have the reindeer at your own event? Look at our <a href="./booking">booking information</a> to get started!

			Shortsville Reindeer farm is now closed for the summer except for special events such as yoga.
			The good news is, we will be opening for visits during the holiday season but with protocols to keep everyone safe and healthy.
			We will be limiting all visits to 50 people maximum. Unlike last year, you must schedule your visit to ensure we stay below 50 visitors at a time.
			Visit our <a href="./booking.html">bookings page</a> to schedule your visit!
			We will donate 10% of each admission ticket from November 27 to December 24 to Foodlink.

			For special events, watch this page or 
			<a href="https://www.facebook.com/ShortsvilleReindeerFarm/">follow us on Facebook</a>.
