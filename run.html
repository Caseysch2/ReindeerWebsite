  This event is in the very preliminary stages. If I can get all the permits together, we will have a one mile
  run/walk/stroll along Rt 21. I have a one mile USATF  certified course from Shortsville to Manchester.
  The reindeer will be there running and walking. This event is geared more toward the families but will be chip
  timed for the more serious runners. There will be an admission fee and 100% of the profits will go to the
  Red Jacket PTSA Backpack program to feed the needy in the community. I will post more info as I get my act
  together and finalize the concept. Please share <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/365911847651995" target="_blank"> this event on Facebook</a>.
