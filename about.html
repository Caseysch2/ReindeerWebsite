    <h2>Who we are</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to the Shortsville Reindeer Farm. We are a tiny little farm in a tiny little town in Western New York.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 1994 we bought about 25 acres of corn field and built our home in the middle of the lot while raising a family of two daughters and two sons.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through the years we converted the land into our own little hobby farm. We planted hundreds of trees, dug a few ponds and enjoyed our little slice of the world as the kids grew up. We have raised turkeys and pheasants. We have had “pet” chickens and peacocks. We maintain 2-6 honeybee hives, the numbers depending on the winter losses. And we have been making a token amount of maple syrup in our little wood fired sugar shack for many years. We aren’t in the business of selling eggs, honey or syrup. The amount we make is just too small. Mostly we just give away the results of our hobbies.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our latest addition to the farm started on Christmas Day, 2015. After reading an article online about various reindeer owners in the lower 48 (https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/25/business/reindeer-for-hire-work-long-hours-in-months-before-christmas.html) and attending a ROBA (Reindeer Owners and Breeders Association) conference, we decided that a few reindeer would make a nice addition to our farm. Over the next few years, coordinating with local, state, and federal agencies as well as several veteran reindeer owners, we cleared a few acres of brush, planted grasses reindeer could eat, built fences, constructed a barn and got ready to accept our first two reindeer.
    </p>
    <p>
        In September of 2017 we were able to achieve the goal and welcomed the arrival of two bull calves, Moose and Little Buddy. Though Moose and Little Buddy are our only reindeer, we hope to expand to a total of six in the next few years.
    </p>

    <h2>What we do</h2>
    <p>
        Unlike our chicken, honey, and maple syrup hobbies which we still currently enjoy, the reindeer "business" is proving to be a little bit more extensive than planned. If you’ve ever read the book “If You Give a Mouse a Cookie” you’ll know exactly what I mean.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you give a mouse a reindeer, chances are he’ll want a new barn. If you give him the barn, chances are he’ll want to put lights in it. If you let him put lights in it, chances are he’ll also want a water line to it. If you give him all that, chances are he’ll want to invite guests out to see it. If too many guests are interested, chances are he’ll want to take the reindeer out to festivals. If you let him take the reindeer out to festivals, chances are he’ll want a new trailer to transport them. If you give him a new trailer chances are he’ll want a new truck to pull the trailer. And if more and more people want to see the reindeer, chances are he’ll want more reindeer. And on and on it goes.
