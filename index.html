		Welcome to the Shortsville Reindeer Farm. We are a tiny little farm in a tiny little town in Western New York. We started a small a herd of reindeer in 2017.  Why reindeer? Well... who wouldn't want a pet reindeer? Our reindeer are gentle, social animals and enjoy following us around as we work in the pasture and add a sense of wonder to our days.
	</p>
	<p>
		Today we share the joy by bringing our pets out to community events and welcoming visitors to our farm on a few days each year.
