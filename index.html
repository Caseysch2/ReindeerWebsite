	<h2>About the Shortsville Reindeer Farm</h2>
	In 2017 Mike Schaertl, feeling as if he had not yet fully realized his dream of being a world-renowned eccentric,
	decided that what his life was really missing was some mystical ungulates. With the unparalled patience and help
	of his wife the octagonal barn went up and the first reindeer arrived. Today there are two reindeer living
	at the Shortsville Reindeer Farm: Little Buddy and Moose.

	<h2>Can I come pet them?</h2>
	Yes you may! Come see us at any of our <a href="./events.html">events</a>! No dogs or pets please.

	<h2>Why would any sane person buy reindeer?</h2>
	What can I say except "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79DijItQXMM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">You're Welcome"</a>?
