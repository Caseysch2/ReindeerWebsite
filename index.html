	Hi there! I'm not sure how you found this website, but keep it secret for a little bit, okay?
	It's a surprise for the reindeer owners.

	<h2>About the Shortsville Reindeer Farm</h2>
	In 2017 Mike Schaertl, feeling as if he had not yet fully realized his dream of being a world-renowned eccentric,
	decided that what his life was really missing was some mystical ungulates. With the unparalled patience and help
	of his wife the octagonal barn went up and the first reindeer arrived. Today there are three reindeer living
	at the Shortsville Reindeer Farm: Little Brother, Little Buddy, and Moose.

	<h2>Can I come pet them?</h2>
	Yes you may! Stop by for any of our events! No dogs or pets please.

	<h2>Why would any sane person buy reindeer?</h2>
	What can I say except "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=79DijItQXMM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">You're Welcome"</a>?
