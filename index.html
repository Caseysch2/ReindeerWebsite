		<b>Welcome to the Shortsville Reindeer Farm.</b> We are a tiny little farm in a tiny little town in Western New York. We started a small a herd of reindeer in 2017.  Why reindeer? Well... who wouldn't want a pet reindeer? These gentle, social animals enjoy following us around as we work in the pasture and add a sense of wonder to our days.
		Today we share the joy by bringing our pets out to community events and hosting events on the farm. <b>Visits are by appointment only.  </b>
