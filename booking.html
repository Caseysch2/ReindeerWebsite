	<h2>Visit the reindeer</h2>
	<p>
		We will be opening for visits during the holiday season but with protocols to keep everyone safe and healthy, including limiting all visits to 50 people maximum.
		Unlike last year, you must schedule your visit to ensure we stay below 50 visitors at a time. 
		We will donate 10% of each admission ticket from November 27 to December 24 to Foodlink.
