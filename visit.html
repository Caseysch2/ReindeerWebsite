	<h2>Before You Go</h2>
	<div class="content-section">
		After you've booked your visit to our farm Shortsville, NY, we would love to host you. However, there are some guidelines we have to make this a safe and pleasant visit for you and the reindeer.
		<div class="list-with-image">
			<ul>
				<li>
					PLEASE do not feed the reindeer unless the handler allows you to.
				</li>
				<li>
					Our reindeer do not eat candy canes, carrots, cookies. Please do not bring them into the pen.
				</li>
				<li>
					Screaming and quick movements tend to startle the reindeer. Please use inside voices around them.
				</li>
				<li>
					You may pet the reindeer only under supervision of the handler.
				</li>
				<li>
					When lines are long, please be considerate of others who are also waiting to see the reindeer.
				</li>
				<li>
					Please don't wear boots or clothing that has been recently exposed to sheep or goats. Goats and sheep harbor an airborne virus that is deadly to the reindeer.
				</li>
				<li>
					Please park in my lawn where the parking attendants request.
				</li>
				<li>
					If taking pictures in the sleigh, please use the step stool and don't step on the sides of the sleigh
				</li>
				<li>
					Please put all trash in the proper containers. Reindeer, like infants, are very curious and will put everything in their mouths.
				</li>
			</ul>

What you WILL see is a sign at the end of the driveway "Reindeer Dr". This is the entrance to our driveway, please enter and follow the instructions of the parking attendants.
