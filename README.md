# ReindeerWebsite
Welcome to the code base for the Shortsville Reindeer Farm Website!

## How to edit the site
1. Contact the repository owner to be added as a collaborator. 
2. The easiest way to make changes is to go to the file you want to change, click the little "Edit" pencil at the top right of the file, and make your changes in the browser.
3. Once you're done, add a title and a description describing what you changed and then "Commit changes" directly to the master branch.

The website is automatically and immediately deployed.

(Is this the 'proper' way to use git? Not really. Does it work anyway? Absolutely. Since this is a low-traffic site and code base everything should... be... fine...)

## Your site is so small and bland. You should add [cool new thing] to it!
Thank you and no thank you.
